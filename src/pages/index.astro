        <p>This feature simplifies the creation of multi-dimensional layouts, making it easier to build responsive and flexible designs. It's a significant enhancement for web developers seeking pixel-perfect control over their layouts.</p>

        <!-- Feature 2: Scroll Snap -->
        <h3>Scroll Snap 📜</h3>
        <p>Scroll Snap is a CSS property that enables smooth scrolling experiences on web pages. With Scroll Snap, you can define specific points where the scroll should stop, creating intuitive navigation through content.</p>
        <p>It's perfect for image galleries, carousels, and long articles. Users will appreciate the precise control over scrolling, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
    

        <!-- Feature 3: CSS Custom Properties (Variables) in Media Queries -->
        <h3>CSS Custom Properties (Variables) in Media Queries 🎨</h3>
        <p>Custom Properties, also known as CSS Variables, have been a staple for managing design systems. Now, you can use them directly in media queries, allowing for dynamic responsive designs.</p>

        <p>The CSS Contain property is designed to improve rendering performance by isolating elements from the rest of the page. It's particularly useful for complex web applications with many components.</p>
        <p>By declaring containment, you can minimize layout recalculations and repaints, resulting in faster load times and smoother interactions. It's a valuable tool for optimizing web performance.</p>
   

        <!-- Feature 6: CSS Nesting -->
        <h3>CSS Nesting 📦</h3>
